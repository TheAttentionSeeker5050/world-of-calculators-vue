        About the Site and it's Creator
    </h1>

    <p class="">
        This site was made by me, Nicolas Castellano, a developer residing in Nova Scotia. This website is a demostration of some of my skills in node.js, vue.js and cloud deployment. This is a very simple website but I have some plans for it to increase its capabilities. Additionally, my intend is to apply the best design practices and testing. This is designed to be fast, complete, sober and with a well understandable source code.
